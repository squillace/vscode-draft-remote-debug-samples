# NOTE: IMPORTANT. If you're setting this up yourself, there's a  var image = "squillace/golang" line in the brigade.js file for this repository. that's because this application pushes its images to the docker hub repo of "squillace/golang". You need to have that value match the container registry that you use below. For example, if I wanted to use ACR, then my image value would be squillace.azurecr.io/golang, and then the pull will come from ACR with that image.
